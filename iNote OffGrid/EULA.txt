EXHIBIT A
TERMS OF SERVICE
Terms of Service for GameHouse FunPass

1. PAYMENT, CANCELLATION & SERVICES
Following the expiration of a trial period that may be provided to you in the sole discretion of OG, you agree to pay OG the applicable service charges (e.g., monthly, quarterly or annual) for your use of the Services using a valid credit card, plus any applicable taxes, in accordance with the billing terms and prices in effect at the time the fee or charge becomes payable. You authorize OG to automatically bill the charge card you provide each month or on each applicable subscription period renewal date, or withdraw funds via electronic transfer from your checking account (depending on what type of charge card you are using), until you cancel the Services. Payments are billed in advance at the beginning of the applicable month or at the beginning of the applicable subscription period if not monthly. All payments are completely non-refundable. You may cancel the Services at any time, but OG will not refund any remaining portion of your subscription fees, including any minimum commitments, already billed to your account. To ensure that your credit card will not be charged for your next billing period, you MUST cancel your FunPass membership no later than the day before your next scheduled billing period begins The exceptions to this refund policy are cancellations of a quarterly or annual subscription within the first 30 days following your first payment or renewal payment of the annual subscription. In this case, you may request a refund of the full annual subscription fee if your cancellation request is received and processed by OG within this 30 day period. After 30 days following your first payment or renewal payment of an annual subscription, you may still cancel at any time but all payments will be non-refundable for the unused portion of your annual subscription. In this case, your account will remain active until the end of the original billing period, but will not be renewed. You agree to provide OG with a valid credit card and accurate, complete and updated information required by the subscription registration form. Failure to comply may result in the immediate termination of Services. Once your cancellation is effective, you will no longer have access to the FunPass service, and you will no longer receive FunPass member discounts on purchases of downloadable products.

OG will assess an additional 1.5% (or the highest amount allowed by law, whichever is lower) per month late charge if your payment is more than 30 days past due. That amount is also due immediately. You are responsible and liable for any fees, including attorney and collection fees, that OG may incur in its efforts to collect any remaining balances from you. You also agree that you will be billed for and will pay any outstanding balances if you cancel the Services, or the Services are terminated. You agree to notify OG about any billing problems or discrepancies within 90 days after they first appear on your account statement. If you do not bring them to OG's attention within 90 days, you agree that you waive your right to dispute such problems or discrepancies.

During your active subscription period, you are entitled to receive US$5 off any additional game purchases.

2. FREE TRIAL POLICY
Any customer that signs up for FunPass may be given a period of time to try the service at no cost. At the end of the period, if the customer has not cancelled their subscription they will be billed as a FunPass member in normal standing. If the subscriber cancels their FunPass membership at any time during their normal membership or trial period, they forfeit the right to any FunPass free trial for six months. This six-month time period starts from the last day of the previous free trial period.

3. OffGrid RIGHT TO TERMINATE OR MODIFY SERVICES
OG may modify the terms of this Agreement or the Services, including but not limited to the price, content or nature of the Services, upon notice to you. In the event OG modifies the Agreement or the Services, you may terminate the Services. OG may terminate this Agreement and any Services at any time upon notice to you, provided that you will be entitled to receive the Services for any period for which you have already paid, or a pro-rata refund at OG's sole discretion. OG may provide notice by e-mail or by publishing the changes on its website. This Agreement will automatically terminate if you fail to comply with any term. No notice shall be required from OG to effect such termination. Upon any termination of this Agreement (whether by you or OG), you shall immediately discontinue use of the Services. Your obligation to pay accrued charges and fees shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

4. SERVICE USE RESTRICTIONS
You agree that you shall only use the Services in a manner that complies with all applicable laws in the jurisdictions in which you use the Services, including, but not limited to, applicable restrictions concerning copyright and other intellectual property rights. Except as specifically authorized herein, you may not: (i) permit other individuals to use the Services; (ii) modify, translate, distribute or create derivative works of the Services; (iii) rent, lease, transfer, or otherwise transfer rights to the Services; and (iv) remove any proprietary notices or labels on the Service.

You may not attempt to, in conjunction with, any device, software program or service, circumvent technological measures employed to control access to, or the rights in, a content file. The Service embodies a copy management system required by the laws of the United States, and you may not circumvent or attempt to circumvent this system by any means.

In addition to any other remedies available in equity or law to OG and OG's content suppliers, failure to comply with any of the terms and conditions in this Section 4 "Service Use Restrictions" shall immediately terminate your license to the Content and the Services.
